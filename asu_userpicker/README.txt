DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
Provides a custom user field widget for picking users in Drupal and ASU Solr, 
and automatically creating selected user accounts for those not yet in Drupal.

INSTALLATION

information.

Configuration
--------------------------
The ASU Userpicker module creates an AJAX autocomplete userpicker widget
and is easily assignable to user reference fields using the Fields
"manage fields display" UI.

The autocomplete route (asu_userpicker.autocomplete) could be used in for other
forms in Drupal by leveraging it via a form alter implementation.
